I’m Ling MA, Christy, currently a master student at Cornell University in Information Science. 

From 2020 to 2024, I had my B.Sc degree in Creative Media at City University of Hong Kong, where focus on computer science and interactivity. I also had a double major degree in Business Analysis. I worked as undergraduate research assistant at the [STUDIO FOR NARRATIVE SPACES](https://recfro.github.io/), supervised by [Prof. RAY LC](https://raylc.org/).

My research interests primary lie in the intersection of Human-AI Interaction and its creative practice. I’m also working on how interactive technology can be further introduced in education and commercial side.
